# This .htaccess file redirects all requests to index.html in a React Single Page Application (SPA).
# In an SPA, client-side routing handles navigation. Direct URL access or page refreshes may cause 404 errors
# because the server looks for files that don't exist. This file ensures React Router Dom handles all routing.
